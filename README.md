# Terraform AWS EC2 Demo

This repository contains a simple Terraform configuration to create an EC2 instance in AWS. It's designed for educational purposes to demonstrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

## Architecture Overview

The configuration creates:
- A security group allowing SSH access
- An EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2 in the default VPC

## Prerequisites

1. An AWS account
2. AWS Access Key and Secret Key with appropriate permissions
3. A key pair in AWS (for SSH access to EC2)
4. GitHub account

## GitHub Actions Setup

The workflow will automatically run on:
- Push to main branch
- Pull request to main branch

### Required Secrets and Variables

In your GitHub repository, set up these secrets:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret key

And these variables:
- `AWS_REGION`: Your preferred AWS region (e.g., us-west-2)
- `KEY_NAME`: The name of your AWS key pair

To set these up:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Add the secrets and variables

## Local Development

1. Install Terraform:
   ```bash
   brew install terraform   # For macOS
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd terraform-cicd
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Create a plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the changes:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. To destroy the infrastructure:

   **Local Destruction:**
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

   **CI/CD Destruction:**
   1. Go to Actions tab in the repository
   2. Select "Terraform Destroy" workflow
   3. Click "Run workflow"
   4. Select environment and provide reason for destruction
   5. Submit the workflow
   6. Appropriate reviewers will be notified for approval
   7. After approval and wait timer, destruction will proceed

## Important Notes

- The EC2 instance is created with a t2.micro instance type (free tier eligible)
- The security group allows SSH access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) - modify for production use
- Remember to destroy resources when not needed to avoid unnecessary charges
